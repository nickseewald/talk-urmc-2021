# What is a dynamic treatment regimen?

A **dynamic treatment regimen (DTR)** is

- an *intervention* design that 
- adapts the type, timing, intensity, or dose of treatment over time
- according to a patient's specific and changing needs.

--

In practice, a dynamic treatment regimen is a sequence of decision rules that can be used to guide how treatment can be adapted and readapted to an individual.

--
.center[
### Sounds a lot like clinical practice!

--
**MANY other names**: adaptive intervention, adaptive treatment strategy, individualized treatment rule, treatment algorithm, individualized intervention...

# A dynamic treatment regimen is an *intervention design*, NOT an experimental design.

We'll talk about experiments soon!

---
# 5 components of a DTR

Dynamic treatment regimens consist of

1. Decision points
1. Tailoring variable(s)
1. Intervention options
1. Decision rule(s)
1. Proximal and distal outcomes

---
# Example DTR: Alcohol Use Disorder

- **Naltrexone** is known to diminish pleasurable effects of alcohol `r Citep(bib, "oslinTargetingTreatmentsAlcohol2006", max.names = 1)`

- Response to naltrexone is heterogeneous (adherence, biology, social support, etc.) `r Citep(bib, "nahum-shaniSMARTDataAnalysis2017", max.names = 1)`

- Heterogeneity necessitates a supportive intervention alongside naltrexone
  - **Medical management**: face-to-face clinical support + adherence monitoring
  - **Combined behavioral intervention**: targets patient's motivation for change, emphasizes social support `r Citep(bib, "longabaughOriginsIssuesOptions2005", max.names = 1)`

1. Decision points
1. Tailoring variable(s)
1. Intervention options
1. Decision rule(s)
1. Proximal and distal outcomes

---
# Example DTR: Decision Points

A **decision point** is a time at which treatment might be adapted to the individual.

![:scale 90%](images/decision_points.png)
- **Decision point 1:** Treatment outset -- decide how to initiate treatment
- **Decision point 2:** Adjust treatment after 8 weeks

---
# Example DTR: Tailoring Variables

A **tailoring variable** is used to individualize treatment at each decision point. Can be static (age, baseline risk, etc.) or dynamic (adherence to treatment, disease severity, etc.)

![](images/tailoring_variable.png)

---
# Example DTR: Tailoring Variables

.center[![:scale 80%](images/tailoring_variable.png)]

Here, the tailoring variable is the **number of self-reported heavy drinking days following treatment initiation**.

- $\geq$ 2 heavy drinking days $\rightarrow$ _non-responder_
- $<$ 2 heavy drinking days $\rightarrow$ _responder_

---
# Some Notes on Tailoring Variables

Note that the tailoring variable is _pre-specified_ and _well-defined_.

- Tailoring variables **are part of the intervention**!
  - Should be based on _practical_, _ethical_, or _scientific_ considerations.
  
--

.center[
### We'll come back to how to choose a tailoring variable.
]

---
# Example DTR: Intervention Options

- **Intervention options** at each decision point might be aspects of treatment: type, intensity, dose, delivery method, timing, etc.

- Here, intervention options are combinations of _naltrexone_, _medical management_, and _combined behavioral intervention_

.center[
  ![](images/intervention_options.png)
]

---
# Example DTR: Intervention Options

- In subsequent stages, could be _adaptation strategies_ like "augment", "intensify" or "stay the course".

.center[
  ![](images/intervention_options_strat.png)
]

---
# Example DTR: Decision Rules

.center[
  ![:scale 90%](images/decision_rule_init.png)
]

A **decision rule** recommends an _intervention option_ for individuals at each decision point, possibly based on prior information (i.e., a tailoring variable)

]

A **decision rule** recommends an _intervention option_ for individuals at each decision point, possibly based on prior information (i.e., a tailoring variable)

---
# Example DTR: Proximal & Distal Outcomes

A dynamic treatment regimen's design should be guided by both short-term (**proximal**) and long-term (**distal**) outcomes

- **Distal outcomes** are the long-term goals of the DTR
  - Long-term, example DTR should reduce _likelihood of alcohol use relapse_
  
- **Proximal outcomes** are the near-term goals of the DTR; perhaps a mechanism by which we can achieve the distal outcome.
  - Short-term, we want to lower risk of relapse by reducing the _proportion of drinking and heavy-drinking days over 8 weeks after adaptation_ `r Citep(bib, "leiSMARTDesignBuilding2012", max.names = 1)`
  
---
# Scientific Questions about DTRs

Often unanswered questions about how to sequence and adapt interventions! Typically related to
  - relative effectiveness of different DTRs
  - relative effectiveness of different intervention options
  - how intervention options work with/against each other

--

###Common Questions
1. Which treatment option should the dynamic treatment regimen begin with?
1. How should we modify treatment for initial non-responders?
1. How should we modify treatment for initial responders?
1. How do we _define_ response/non-response?
1. How should we time decision points?

---
# Alcohol Use Disorder: Scientific Questions

- How do we define non-response to naltrexone in the context of a dynamic treatment regimen?
  - Unclear how many heavy drinking days indicate a need to augment treatment

- What treatments should be offered following the initial intervention (naltrexone + medical management)?
  - More intense support for non-responders?
  - Do responders need a supportive intervention alongside naltrexone?

--

## Let's now discuss an experimental design which can help answer these questions

# Sequential, Multiple-Assignment Randomized Trials (SMARTs)

![](https://c.tenor.com/J2V8sWAs-igAAAAC/geek-cat-studious.gif)

---
# SMARTs

A **sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial** is _one type_ of randomized trial design that can be used to answer questions at multiple stages of the development of a high-quality dynamic treatment regimen.

--

The key feature of a SMART is that some (or all) participants are randomized _more than once_.

# How do SMARTs inform DTR development?

Randomizations in a SMART correspond to open scientific questions about constructing a dynamic treatment regimen!

In ExTENd,

- First randomization seeks to answer a question about definition of non-response

- Second randomization in responders investigates whether lower-intensity medical management ("telehealth") is needed as maintenance therapy

- Second randomization in non-responders looks at the effect of naltrexone in the context of combined behavioral intervention + medical management

---
# Do I need a SMART?

SMARTs are designed to answer questions about the development of high-quality dynamic treatment regimes.

Consider a SMART if...

1. You want to develop a DTR
1. There are open questions preventing the construction of an effective DTR
1. There are open questions at _multiple decision points_ within a DTR

--

If any of these aren't true, you don't need a SMART!

# Design Considerations: Tailoring Variables

Tailoring variables are often used to **restrict randomization** (recommend different intervention options to different subgroups of participants)

Tailoring variables should be **well-justified**: remember, they're part of the DTRs!

You do **not** need to restrict randomization!

---
# Design Considerations: Tailoring Variables

If you restrict randomization, do so based on ethical, scientific, and/or practical considerations.

--

- **Ethical:** Treatment options should be appropriate for the subset of participants

--

- **Scientific:** Options should be based on already-established empirical evidence 

--

- **Practical:** You might save more intense or costly options for those who need it most (e.g.)

--

### Ultimately, _keep it simple_.

---
# Design Considerations: Aims

Focus on a few scientific aims about developing a high-quality DTR.


- **Primary aim:** Choose sample size based on this aim

- **Secondary aims:** Leverage rich data on treatment sequences to further inform a DTR
