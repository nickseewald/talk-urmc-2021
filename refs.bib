  abstract = {In clinical or educational practice, it is often necessary to use an individually tailored, sequential approach to intervention in order to improve outcomes. Adaptive interventions (also known as dynamic treatment regimens) can be used to guide such sequential intervention decision-making. Adaptive interventions are multicomponent, multistage intervention packages. The multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) is a comprehensive research framework for development, optimization, and evaluation of multicomponent intervention packages, such as adaptive interventions. When working within the optimization phase of MOST, behavioral, biobehavioral, and educational intervention scientists often have important scientific questions about how best to optimize an adaptive intervention. This chapter discusses various types of experimental designs that can be used to optimize an adaptive intervention. In some of these, participants are randomized once over the course of the trial (i.e., singly randomized trials, or SRTs), and in others, participants are randomized at multiple stages (i.e., sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials, or SMARTs). The choice between SRT and SMART ultimately is driven by the scientific questions that the intervention scientist seeks to answer. Motivated by the development of an adaptive intervention to improve social skills and academic engagement among children with autism, we illustrate these ideas by presenting four example of experimental designs: two examples of a SRT and two examples of a SMART. We present the rationale for each experimental design and the questions each is designed to answer. In doing so, this chapter provides an expanded set of tools that investigators aiming to develop an adaptive intervention can draw from within the MOST optimization phase toolbox.},

  abstract = {Implementation study is an important tool for deploying state-of-the-art treatments from clinical efficacy studies into a treatment program, with the dual goals of learning about effectiveness of the treatments and improving the quality of care for patients enrolled into the program. In this article, we deal with the design of a treatment program of dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) for patients with depression post-acute coronary syndrome. We introduce a novel adaptive randomization scheme for a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial of DTRs. Our approach adapts the randomization probabilities to favor treatment sequences having comparatively superior Q-functions used in Q-learning. The proposed approach addresses three main concerns of an implementation study: it allows incorporation of historical data or opinions, it includes randomization for learning purposes, and it aims to improve care via adaptation throughout the program. We demonstrate how to apply our method to design a depression treatment program using data from a previous study. By simulation, we illustrate that the inputs from historical data are important for the program performance measured by the expected outcomes of the enrollees, but also show that the adaptive randomization scheme is able to compensate poorly specified historical inputs by improving patient outcomes within a reasonable horizon. The simulation results also confirm that the proposed design allows efficient learning of the treatments by alleviating the curse of dimensionality.},

  abstract = {Sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) are a useful and increasingly popular approach for gathering information to inform the construction of adaptive interventions to treat psychological and behavioral health conditions. Until recently, analysis methods for data from SMART designs considered only a single measurement of the outcome of interest when comparing the efficacy of adaptive interventions. Lu et al. proposed a method for considering repeated outcome measurements to incorporate information about the longitudinal trajectory of change. While their proposed method can be applied to many kinds of outcome variables, they focused mainly on linear models for normally distributed outcomes. Practical guidelines and extensions are required to implement this methodology with other types of repeated outcome measures common in behavioral research. In this article, we discuss implementation of this method with repeated binary outcomes. We explain how to compare adaptive interventions in terms of various summaries of repeated binary outcome measures, including average outcome (area under the curve) and delayed effects. The method is illustrated using an empirical example from a SMART study to develop an adaptive intervention for engaging alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients in treatment. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed technique.},

ATS' arise when chronic diseases such as cancer and depression are treated over time with various treatment alternatives depending on intermediate responses to earlier treatments. Clinical trials are often designed to compare ATSs based on appropriate designs such as sequential randomization designs. Although recent literature provides statistical methods for analyzing data from such trials, very few articles have focused on statistical power and sample size issues. This paper presents a sample size formula for comparing the survival probabilities under two treatment strategies sharing same initial, but different maintenance treatment. The formula is based on the large sample properties of inverse-probability-weighted estimator. Simulation study shows strong evidence that the proposed sample size formula guarantees desired power, regardless of the true distributions of survival times.},

Often, the individuals and families served by substance use preventive interventions are widely heterogeneous both in background (e.g., initial risk prior to intervention) and in response to the intervention (e.g., intervention adherence or engagement, or change in risk). Adaptive preventive interventions have the potential to reduce the risk of substance use and abuse for a greater number of individuals, relative to one-intervention-for-all approaches to prevention, because they respond to this heterogeneity. An important framework in prevention science distinguishes between universal, selective, and indicated intervention tiers or components. The first contribution of this chapter is to illustrate different types of adaptive preventive interventions and describe how they fit within the universal, selective, and indicated framework. Specifically, we will illustrate, via four examples, how adaptive preventive interventions may lead to a sequence of interventions within or across these categories. The second contribution of this chapter responds to the growing interest in the use of sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs as a tool for addressing open scientific questions that prevention scientists confront when developing adaptive preventive interventions.},

  abstract = {Objective This study tested the effect of beginning treatment with a speech-generating device (SGD) in the context of a blended, adaptive treatment design for improving spontaneous, communicative utterances in school-aged, minimally verbal children with autism. Method A total of 61 minimally verbal children with autism, aged 5 to 8 years, were randomized to a blended developmental/behavioral intervention (JASP+EMT) with or without the augmentation of a SGD for 6 months with a 3-month follow-up. The intervention consisted of 2 stages. In stage 1, all children received 2 sessions per week for 3 months. Stage 2 intervention was adapted (by increased sessions or adding the SGD) based on the child's early response. The primary outcome was the total number of spontaneous communicative utterances; secondary measures were the total number of novel words and total comments from a natural language sample. Results Primary aim results found improvements in spontaneous communicative utterances, novel words, and comments that all favored the blended behavioral intervention that began by including an SGD (JASP+EMT+SGD) as opposed to spoken words alone (JASP+EMT). Secondary aim results suggest that the adaptive intervention beginning with JASP+EMT+SGD and intensifying JASP+EMT+SGD for children who were slow responders led to better posttreatment outcomes. Conclusion Minimally verbal school-aged children can make significant and rapid gains in spoken spontaneous language with a novel, blended intervention that focuses on joint engagement and play skills and incorporates an SGD. Future studies should further explore the tailoring design used in this study to better understand children's response to treatment.

A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a multi-stage trial design that can be used to construct effective DTRs.

Based on a Wald test that compares two embedded DTRs of interest from the `weighted and replicated' regression model, a sample size calculation is presented with a corresponding user-friendly applet to aid in the process of designing a SMART. The analytic models and sample size calculations are presented for three of the more commonly used two-stage SMART designs. Simulations for the sample size calculation show the empirical power reaches expected levels. A data analysis example with corresponding code is presented in the appendix using data from a SMART developing an effective DTR in autism.},

These two linked topics have generated a great deal of interest as researchers have recognized the importance of comparing entire strategies for managing chronic disease. A number of articles emerged from that workshop. Purpose The purpose of this survey of the DTS/SMART methodology (which is taken from the introductory talk in the workshop) is to provide the reader the collected articles presented in this volume with sufficient background to appreciate the more detailed discussions in the articles. Methods The way that the DTS arises naturally in clinical practice is described, along with its connection to the well-known difficulties of interpreting the analysis by intention-to-treat. The SMART methodology for comparing DTS is described, and the basics of estimation and inference presented. Results The DTS/SMART methodology can be a flexible and practical way to optimize ongoing clinical decision making, providing evidence (based on randomization) for comparative effectiveness. Limitations The DTS/SMART methodology is not a solution for unstandardized study protocols. Conclusions The DTS/SMART methodology has growing relevance to comparative effectiveness research and the needs of the learning healthcare system.

Altering the intensity and type of intervention over time is crucial for many reasons, such as to obtain improvement if the individual is not responding or to reduce costs and burden when intensive treatment is no longer necessary. Adaptive interventions utilize individual variables (severity, preferences) to adapt the intervention and then dynamically utilize individual outcomes (response to treatment, adherence) to readapt the intervention. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) provides high-quality data that can be used to construct adaptive interventions. We review the SMART and highlight its advantages in constructing and revising adaptive interventions as compared to alternative experimental designs. Selected examples of SMART studies are described and compared. A data analysis method is provided and illustrated using data from the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone SMART study.},

  abstract = {Two-stage randomized trials are growing in importance in developing adaptive treatment strategies, i.e. treatment policies or dynamic treatment regimes. Usually, the first stage involves randomization to one of the several initial treatments. The second stage of treatment begins when an early nonresponse criterion or response criterion is met. In the second-stage, nonresponding subjects are re-randomized among second-stage treatments. Sample size calculations for planning these two-stage randomized trials with failure time outcomes are challenging because the variances of common test statistics depend in a complex manner on the joint distribution of time to the early nonresponse criterion or response criterion and the primary failure time outcome. We produce simple, albeit conservative, sample size formulae by using upper bounds on the variances. The resulting formulae only require the working assumptions needed to size a standard single-stage randomized trial and, in common settings, are only mildly conservative. These sample size formulae are based on either a weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival probabilities at a fixed time-point or a weighted version of the log-rank test.},

Methods: The core issue of how to deliver a flexible therapy tailored to the needs of individual clients while at the same time providing a standardized treatment protocol for a randomized clinical trial provided the dilemma out of which this unique standardized protocol arose. By using a single decision tree, client choice, combined with limited options, we were able to reconcile these conflicting demands.

In alcohol-dependent participants, 24-month {$\gamma$}-glutamyltransferase levels were lower in TEL than in RP (P~=~.005). In cocaine-dependent participants, there was a significant group~\texttimes ~time interaction (P~=~.03) in which the rate of cocaine-positive urine samples increased more rapidly in RP as compared with TEL. On percentage of days abstinent or negative consequences of substance use, TEL did not differ from RP or STND. Participants with high scores on a composite risk indicator, based on co-occurring alcohol and cocaine dependence and poor progress toward achieving intensive outpatient program goals, had better total abstinence outcomes up to 21 months if they received STND rather than TEL, whereas those with lower scores had higher abstinence rates in TEL than in STND (P~=~.04).Telephone-based continuing care appears to be an effective form of step-down treatment for most patients with alcohol and cocaine dependence who complete an initial stabilization treatment, compared with more intensive face-to-face interventions.

Clinical trials have primarily scientific aims and rarely attempt to collectively improve the outcomes of their participants. The overarching goal of most clinical trials is to evaluate the effect of a treatment on disease outcomes. Comparisons are usually made with placebo for conditions having no established treatments and with standard care for conditions having effective treatments. Any benefit to an individual trial participant is a chance effect of randomization and the true, but unknown, relative effects of the treatments. Available evidence is conflicting regarding whether patients receive some benefit from simply participating in a clinical trial. Thus, even though serving as a research participant is essentially an altruistic activity, many clinical trial volunteers do not participate in research out of altruism. An adaptive clinical trial design can be used to increase the likelihood that study participants will benefit by being in a clinical trial.},

Adaptive treatment strategies provide a vehicle through which these issues can be addressed and thus provide a means toward improving and informing the clinical management of chronic substance abuse disorders.

First, we define causal factorial effects for treatment components that may be applied sequentially to a patient. Second, we propose experimental designs that can be used to study the treatment components. Surprisingly, modifications can be made to (fractional) factorial designs\textemdash more commonly found in the engineering statistics literature\textemdash for screening in this setting.

An adaptive intervention is a protocolized sequence of individualized treatments that seeks to address the unique and changing needs of individuals as they progress through an intervention program. The sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental study design that can be used to build the empirical basis for the construction of effective adaptive interventions. A SMART involves multiple stages of randomizations; each stage of randomization is designed to address scientific questions concerning the best intervention option to employ at that point in the intervention. Several adaptive interventions are embedded in a SMART by design; many SMARTs are motivated by scientific questions that concern the comparison of these embedded adaptive interventions. Until recently, analysis methods available for the comparison of adaptive interventions were limited to end-of-study outcomes. The current article provides an accessible and comprehensive tutorial to a new methodology for using repeated outcome data from SMART studies to compare adaptive interventions. We discuss how existing methods for comparing adaptive interventions in terms of end-of-study outcome data from a SMART can be extended for use with longitudinal outcome data. We also highlight the scientific utility of using longitudinal data from a SMART to compare adaptive interventions. A SMART study aiming to develop an adaptive intervention to engage alcohol- and cocaine-dependent individuals in treatment is used to demonstrate the application of this new methodology.

  abstract = {Cluster-level dynamic treatment regimens can be used to guide sequential treatment decision-making at the cluster level in order to improve outcomes at the individual or patient-level. In a cluster-level dynamic treatment regimen, the treatment is potentially adapted and re-adapted over time based on changes in the cluster that could be impacted by prior intervention, including aggregate measures of the individuals or patients that compose it. Cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trials can be used to answer multiple open questions preventing scientists from developing high-quality cluster-level dynamic treatment regimens. In a cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trial, sequential randomizations occur at the cluster level and outcomes are observed at the individual level. This manuscript makes two contributions to the design and analysis of cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trials. First, a weighted least squares regression approach is proposed for comparing the mean of a patient-level outcome between the cluster-level dynamic treatment regimens embedded in a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial. The regression approach facilitates the use of baseline covariates which is often critical in the analysis of cluster-level trials. Second, sample size calculators are derived for two common clusterrandomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs for use when the primary aim is a betweendynamic treatment regimen comparison of the mean of a continuous patient-level outcome. The methods are motivated by the Adaptive Implementation of Effective Programs Trial which is, to our knowledge, the first-ever cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trial in psychiatry.},

Conditions such as AIDS, depression, and cancer usually require several stages of treatment because of the chronic, multifactorial nature of illness progression and management. Sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMAR) designs permit simultaneous inference about multiple ATSs, where patients are sequentially randomized to treatments at different stages depending upon response status. The purpose of the article is to develop a sample size formula to ensure adequate power for comparing two or more ATSs. Based on a Wald-type statistic for comparing multiple ATSs with a continuous endpoint, we develop a sample size formula and test it through simulation studies. We show via simulation that the proposed sample size formula maintains the nominal power. The proposed sample size formula is not applicable to designs with time-to-event endpoints but the formula will be useful for practitioners while designing SMAR trials to compare adaptive treatment strategies.},

While increasing access to treatment is an important public health approach, increasing the success of treatment is also likely to lead to greater engagement. However, alcohol dependence is a complex disorder likely to consist of several biological subtypes. Recent evidence from a number of different studies has suggested that genetic variation in the mu-opioid receptor has a significant influence on clinical presentation of alcohol problems and response to treatment with an opioid antagonist. Most notably, the A118G polymorphism of the mu-receptor gene has been demonstrated to predict clinical response to naltrexone in alcohol-dependent individuals. This article reviews the biological correlates and outlines a scientific agenda for better understanding the role of opioid neurotransmission in the etiology, maintenance and treatment of alcohol dependence.},

Children with ADHD (ages 5\textendash 12, N = 146, 76\% male) were treated for 1 school year. Children were randomized to initiate treatment with low doses of either (a) behavioral parent training (8 group sessions) and brief teacher consultation to establish a Daily Report Card or (b) extended-release methylphenidate (equivalent to .15 mg/kg/dose bid). After 8 weeks or at later monthly intervals as necessary, insufficient responders were rerandomized to secondary interventions that either increased the dose/intensity of the initial treatment or added the other treatment modality, with adaptive adjustments monthly as needed to these secondary treatments. The group beginning with behavioral treatment displayed significantly lower rates of observed classroom rule violations (the primary outcome) at study endpoint and tended to have fewer out-of-class disciplinary events. Further, adding medication secondary to initial behavior modification resulted in better outcomes on the primary outcomes and parent/teacher ratings of oppositional behavior than adding behavior modification to initial medication. Normalization rates on teacher and parent ratings were generally high. Parents who began treatment with behavioral parent training had substantially better attendance than those assigned to receive training following medication. Beginning treatment with behavioral intervention produced better outcomes overall than beginning treatment with medication.},

  abstract = {Drug addiction is a chronic, devastating, but treatable disorder. A core principle of drug addiction treatment states that no single treatment is appropriate for everyone (NIDA, 2012); treatments need to adjust based on patient characteristics and response in order to be maximally effective. For cocaine use disorders (CUD), specifically, the most potent intervention currently available for initiating abstinence is behavior therapy using contingency management (CM) procedures, with early cessation being a robust predictor of future abstinence. This raises two key questions for treatment development research: First, can we significantly improve initial CM response rates with targeted adjunctive interventions? Second, for individuals who fail to achieve initial abstinence with CM, is pharmacotherapy an effective augmentation strategy? This paper describes how a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design has advantages over a fixed-intervention approach when it comes to collecting data needed to answer both questions. The first aim will examine whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in combination with CM increases initial abstinence response rates (i.e., 2 consecutive weeks of cocaine-negative urine screens). The second aim will examine whether ACT+CM in combination with modafinil promotes abstinence achievement in initial non-responders. Results are expected to inform how we tailor treatment of CUD to maximize outcomes.},

  abstract = {Clinicians and researchers alike are increasingly interested in how best to personalize interventions. A dynamic treatment regimen is a sequence of prespecified decision rules which can be used to guide the delivery of a sequence of treatments or interventions that is tailored to the changing needs of the individual. The sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial is a research tool which allows for the construction of effective dynamic treatment regimens. We derive easy-to-use formulae for computing the total sample size for three common two-stage sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial designs in which the primary aim is to compare mean end-of-study outcomes for two embedded dynamic treatment regimens which recommend different first-stage treatments. The formulae are derived in the context of a regression model which leverages information from a longitudinal outcome collected over the entire study. We show that the sample size formula for a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial can be written as the product of the sample size formula for a standard two-arm randomized trial, a deflation factor that accounts for the increased statistical efficiency resulting from a longitudinal analysis, and an inflation factor that accounts for the design of a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial. The sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial design inflation factor is typically a function of the anticipated probability of response to first-stage treatment. We review modeling and estimation for dynamic treatment regimen effect analyses using a longitudinal outcome from a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, as well as the estimation of standard errors. We also present estimators for the covariance matrix for a variety of common working correlation structures. Methods are motivated using the ENGAGE study, a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial aimed at developing a dynamic treatment regimen for increasing motivation to attend treatments among alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients.},

Despite data showing that only half of participants achieve this goal, a ``one size fits all'' approach is normative. This weight loss intervention science gap calls for adaptive interventions that provide the ``right treatment at the right time for the right person.'' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART), use experimental design principles to answer questions for building adaptive interventions including whether, how, or when to alter treatment intensity, type, or delivery. This paper describes the rationale and design of the BestFIT study, a SMART designed to evaluate the optimal timing for intervening with sub-optimal responders to weight loss treatment and relative efficacy of two treatments that address self-regulation challenges which impede weight loss: 1) augmenting treatment with portion-controlled meals (PCM) which decrease the need for self-regulation; and 2) switching to acceptance-based behavior treatment (ABT) which boosts capacity for selfregulation. The primary aim is to evaluate the benefit of changing treatment with PCM versus ABT. The secondary aim is to evaluate the best time to intervene with sub-optimal responders. BestFIT results will lead to the empirically-supported construction of an adaptive intervention that will optimize weight loss outcomes and associated health benefits.},

  abstract = {In oncology, a patient's treatment often involves multiple courses of chemotherapy. The most common medical practice in choosing treatments for successive courses is to repeat a treatment that is successful in a given course and otherwise switch to a different treatment. Patient outcome thus consists of a sequence of dependent response variables and corresponding treatments. Despite the widespread use of such adaptive `play-the-winner-and-drop-the-loser' algorithms in medical settings involving multiple treatment courses, most statistical methods for treatment evaluation characterize early patient outcome as a single response to a single treatment, resulting in a substantial loss of information. In this paper, we provide a statistical framework for multi-course clinical trials involving some variant of the play-the-winner-and-drop-the-loser strategy. The aim is to design and conduct the trial to more closely reflect actual clinical practice, and thus increase the amount of information per patient. The proposed design is similar to a multi-stage cross-over trial, with the essential difference that here all treatments after the first course are assigned adaptively. We illustrate the method by application to a randomized phase II trial for androgen independent prostate cancer. We consider the goals of selecting one best treatment, or selecting a best ordered pair of treatments with the second given if the first fails to achieve a patient success. A simulation study is reported, and extensions to trials involving toxicity or regimen-related death are discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Therapy of rapidly fatal diseases often requires multiple courses of treatment. In each course, the treatment may achieve the desired clinical goal (``response''), the patient may survive without response (``failure''), or the patient may die. When treatment fails in a given course, it is common medical practice to switch to a different treatment for the next course. Most statistical approaches to such settings simply ignore the multicourse structure. They characterize patient outcome as a single binary variable, combine death and failure, and identify only one treatment for each patient. Such approaches waste important information. We provide a statistical framework, including a family of generalized logistic regression models and an approximate Bayesian method, that incorporates historical data while accommodating multiple treatment courses, a trinary outcome in each course, and patient prognostic covariates. The framework serves as a basis for data analysis, treatment evaluation, and clinical trial design. In contrast with the usual approach of evaluating individual treatments, our methodology evaluates outcome-adaptive, multicourse treatment strategies that specify, within prognostic subgroups, which treatment to give in each course. We describe a general approach for constructing clinical trial designs that may be tailored to different multicourse settings. For each prognostic subgroup, based on a real-valued function of the covariate-adjusted probabilities of response and death, the design drops inferior treatment strategies during the trial and selects the best strategy at the end. The methodology is illustrated in the context of designing a randomized two-course, three-treatment acute leukemia trial with two prognostic covariates. To validate the model and develop a prior, we first fit the model to a historical dataset. We describe a simulation study of the design under several clinical scenarios. The simulations show that the method can reliably identify treatment\textendash subgroup interactions based on moderate sample sizes.},

Specifically, a SMART design is a multistage trial design in which each stage corresponds to a critical decision where there is a scientific question about how best to intervene at that stage. Each participant progresses through the stages and can be randomly assigned to one of several intervention options at each stage. SMART designs allow one to answer a variety of questions concerning the development of a DTR. We highlight some of the common research questions and hypotheses and briefly discuss the appropriate analytical approaches to test these hypotheses.

Two-stage designs, where patients are initially randomized to an induction therapy and then depending upon their response and consent, are randomized to a maintenance therapy, are common in cancer and other clinical trials. The goal is to compare different combinations of primary and maintenance therapies to find the combination that is most beneficial. In practice, the analysis is usually conducted in two separate stages which does not directly address the major objective of finding the best combination. Recently Lunceford, Davidian, and Tsiatis (2002, Biometrics58, 48\textendash 57) introduced ad hoc estimators for the survival distribution and mean restricted survival time under different treatment policies. These estimators are consistent but not efficient, and do not include information from auxiliary covariates. In this article we derive estimators that are easy to compute and are more efficient than previous estimators. We also show how to improve efficiency further by taking into account additional information from auxiliary variables. Large sample properties of these estimators are derived and comparisons with other estimators are made using simulation. We apply our estimators to a leukemia clinical trial data set that motivated this study.},

  abstract = {Two-stage randomisation designs are useful in the evaluation of combination therapies where patients are initially randomised to an induction therapy and then, depending upon their response and consent, are randomised to a maintenance therapy. In this paper we derive the best regular asymptotically linear estimator for the survival distribution and related quantities of treatment regimes. We propose an estimator which is easily computable and is more efficient than existing estimators. Large-sample properties of the proposed estimator are derived and comparisons with other estimators are made using simulation.},

  abstract = {A treatment regime is a rule that assigns a treatment, among a set of possible treatments, to a patient as a function of his/her observed characteristics, hence ``personalizing'' treatment to the patient. The goal is to identify the optimal treatment regime that, if followed by the entire population of patients, would lead to the best outcome on average. Given data from a clinical trial or observational study, for a single treatment decision, the optimal regime can be found by assuming a regression model for the expected outcome conditional on treatment and covariates, where, for a given set of covariates, the optimal treatment is the one that yields the most favorable expected outcome. However, treatment assignment via such a regime is suspect if the regression model is incorrectly specified. Recognizing that, even if misspecified, such a regression model defines a class of regimes, we instead consider finding the optimal regime within such a class by finding the regime that optimizes an estimator of overall population mean outcome. To take into account possible confounding in an observational study and to increase precision, we use a doubly robust augmented inverse probability weighted estimator for this purpose. Simulations and application to data from a breast cancer clinical trial demonstrate the performance of the method.},
